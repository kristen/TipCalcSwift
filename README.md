# Tip Calculator - Tabber

This is an iOS application that allows a user to calculate the tip of a bill and divide the bill by up to four people.  This is the prework assignment for CodePath from their [walkthrough](http://vimeo.com/102084767).

Time spent: 12 hours programming

Completed stories:

 * [x] Required: User can input bill amount and change tip percentage to calculate tip and total bill amount

Notes:

In addition to the 12 hours programming, I spent several hours watching the Stanford [Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550) course videos, reading [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html), and reading documentation on Apple's [iOS Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/).
